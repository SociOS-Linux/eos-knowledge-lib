First we ll write a program called an ingester that downloads the content and makes it suitable for offline viewing. The ingester creates an archive called a hatch. We ll use a tool called Hatch Previewer to examine the hatch and make visual improvements in the ingester. Then we turn the hatch into another more compressed archive called a shard which is used to publish the content. Next we will build a user interface for the app and test it together with the shard. Finally we will show how to put the user interface and one or more shards together into an app which can be published as a flatpak package. \nWe re going to use the blog of the Creative Commons organization itself.
