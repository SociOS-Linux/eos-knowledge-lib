We ll write the ingester in here. \nFirst we want to read the Creative Commons blog s RSS feed and make sure we can parse its entries. For this we ll use the utilities included in libingester. Install it like this \nCreate an index.js. Here s a minimal version that will parse the RSS feed and show which posts we would ingest \nAdd start node index.js to the scripts dictionary in package.json and test the script by running npm start \nYou will probably see no articles. Looking at the libingester API documentation that is because fetch_rss_entries only looks at the previous day of entries. Let s supply some better parameters putting no maximum on the number of posts and a month maximum on the posts age \nThis time npm start prints more post titles but not days worth. Examining the RSS feed shows why it only shows items. This is a problem with a lot of RSS feeds. Unfortunately there isn t a standard way to paginate RSS feeds. However we can see in the RSS feed that it is generated by Wordpress which gives us an easy solution. Wordpress RSS feeds support pagination and since Wordpress is so common libingester includes a utility for paginating them which we can use \nThis works showing three months of posts Let s temporarily change the maximum number of items to for further development in order to save time. \nNOTE There are also environment variables that control these parameters. It would be much more convenient to use the environment variables once you are using the ingester in production but for this tutorial we ll edit the values in the code. \n"});
