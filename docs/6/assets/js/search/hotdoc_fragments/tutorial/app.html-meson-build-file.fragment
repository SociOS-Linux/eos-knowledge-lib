We ll skip over the details of this but just copy the one from the full code. \nIn short the meson.build file automates all the file generating commands that we used above plus a few more. In particular we need to convert the human readable app.yaml file into a more explicit but repetitive app.json and convert the overrides.scss into plain CSS. Previously these conversions were done automatically by ekn app runner when we ran the app. In the Meson file you can see the Meson targets that do this \nWe ll also need to add the generated app.json and overrides.css files to our GResource bundle. It s not required to add the original app.yaml and overrides.scss files but it makes debugging easier at a small size cost so we ll add them as well \nTo test the build inside the sandbox we can build the app and install it into a staging directory named _install \n"});
