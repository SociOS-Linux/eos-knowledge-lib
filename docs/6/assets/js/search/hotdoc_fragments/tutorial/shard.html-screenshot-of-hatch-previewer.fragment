You can also see the metadata on the right hand side. \nBrowse through the posts and take note of anything that looks odd. You can also compare them to the posts on their original website in your browser to make sure nothing is missing. \nThe first thing you might notice is that there are some blank spaces in the article format we used. These will display metadata but haven t been filled in yet. There s a space after the dash at the top right for the date that the post was published. This isn t pre filled because we want to display it in whatever date format the user has selected in their settings and that s impossible to know at this point. \nThere s also a space at the bottom of the post where the tags will go. We won t determine what tags will be used in the app until later so there s nothing to display here yet. \n"});
