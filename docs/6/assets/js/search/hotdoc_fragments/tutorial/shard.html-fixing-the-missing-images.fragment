At the time of this walkthrough s writing this happens in the articles Awesome Organisations Working to Protect and Expand the Public Domain and Thank you to Private Internet Access lead sponsor of CC s Global Summit though of course if you are doing this walkthrough later it may happen in other articles or not at all. If you want to reproduce these results exactly you can set your ingester to page back to a longer time ago. \nWe use the Flip button in Hatch Previewer to figure out why this is happening. The raw HTML for the paragraph with the missing image looks like this \nThe cause is apparent the ingester isn t turning the image into an image asset. The image s location still points to an online address which Hatch Previewer can t access because it runs sandboxed and doesn t have network privileges. Looking back at our ingester code we only looked for images inside a figure tag. \nThe BlogArticle format works best with figure images anyway and not inline img elements so instead of changing our image to asset code to look for the latter we ll transmute them into the former using Cheerio to manipulate the DOM. \n"});
