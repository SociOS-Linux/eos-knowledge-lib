The eminem tool inspects and manipulates subscriptions. It is included in the com.endlessm.Platform flatpak runtime. \nTo retrieve the subscription ID s for a given app ID use eminem inspect app id app_id \nAfter that you can use eminem freeze and eminem unfreeze to marshal the state of the subscription to a file that can be passed around for debugging. If you re seeing bizarre content in a subscription and are afraid of the article being lost before you can investigate you can use freeze and unfreeze to capture the state of a subscription and allow you to restore it for later. \nSubscriptions work through a manifest.json file that contains the shards that make up the current state of the subscription. While normally these manifest files are generated by SOMA if you are trying to build shards locally it can be helpful to just be able to drop an additional shard into a directory and regenerate the manifest.json file to include the new shard. eminem regenerate directory allows you to do that. \n"});
