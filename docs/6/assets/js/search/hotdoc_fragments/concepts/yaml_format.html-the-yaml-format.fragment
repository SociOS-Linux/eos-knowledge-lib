App creators can combine these modules and describe the visual structure of their apps by writing YAML files that follow a specific format. This YAML format exposes the framework API and provides helpers to write these apps descriptions more easily. This document is meant to explain the format of this YAML file. Here s the first example \nThis is the simplest working app that can be described using the YAML format. The app description follows a tree like structure always starting from a root node. Each node represents a module of the framework. The most basic components of a node are \nA real example \nThis example expands the previous one. Now the app is capable of handling pages and displays a list of articles sorted in a sequence on its home page. Extracting one of the nodes to see its components \nThis is a node named arrangement for a module type Arrangement.List which sets a property named expand with only one slot named card. The slots key is used to add sub nodes and to construct the tree. The list of available properties and slots depends on each type of module. As shown in the full example above we can create a wide variety of apps by combining and constructing module trees. \n"});
