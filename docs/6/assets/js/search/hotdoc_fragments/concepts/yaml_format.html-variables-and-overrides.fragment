Each variable is defined with a default value and the variables can be referenced from within the preset using the refvar key. See the example below \nIn this example two variables home arrangement and home card were added to the example from before. These variables are referenced from within the preset using the refvar key. Note that a prefix is needed for referencing variable names. A short form is also available when referencing variables from a node name e.g. card home card. \nOnce variables are available in a preset the app creators can use and customize these presets by overriding the defaults. To override the preset defaults an overrides section must be added to the app description. See the example below \nIn this example the preset is imported and these two variables are overridden. Note that this requires to split the same YAML file in two documents adding the YAML separator. The benefit of using variables overrides is that these are more likely to be kept in future versions of the framework. If a variable is removed from the framework the override will be ignored. \n"});
