So we need to provide proper credit to the creator of the sheep icon. The toolkit provides a facility for doing this. All we have to do is include a file called credits.json in a certain format in the GResource bundle. \nCreate the file credits.json. We ll show only one entry here but you can see the whole thing in the full code section \nThen add the file to the GResource bundle by adding the following lines to app.gresource.xml \nDon t forget to add the file to the Flatpak manifest too \nOnce that is done rebuild the app and you will be able to see the credits by hovering the mouse over the space just to the left of the minimize button in the title bar. An info icon will appear and if you click on it you ll get a credits dialog. \n"});
