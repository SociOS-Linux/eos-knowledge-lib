The pattern is described using Emeus VFL Visual Format Language \nNOTE that this arrangement design is still experimental therefore it visuals and behavior are subject to change. \nThis arrangement can be extended by programmers to implement other constrained arrangements by simply providing a VFL description and the number of cards. \nTo extend this class override the Arrangement.get_max_cards and Constrained.get_description. \n"});
