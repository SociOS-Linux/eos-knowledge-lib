<h1 id="presets">Presets</h1>
<p>The Modular framework has been used for building dozens of apps. As a result, many experience patterns have emerged and turned into pre-defined app experiences or presets. These presets can be re-used and customized by app developers to create new apps. This document is meant to present and describe each of these presets.</p>
<h2 id="library">Library</h2>
<p><img src="concepts/images/presets/library.svg" alt="The Library preset" id="the-library-preset"></p>
<p>Library is a focused experience that guides the user directly to the content through categories. The preset highlights a few featured categories first before revealing all categories, and integrates a table of contents in the article view. Recommended for long-form educational content.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Requires</strong> one level of categories.</li>
<li>Supports HTML, PDF, video and audio articles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Blog is an exploratory experience that starts the user off with fresh content on the homepage, and integrates a fixed side menu for ease of navigation between categories (if the content has categories).
