<h1 id="installing">Installing</h1>
<p>This section will walk through installing the tools needed for this walkthrough on Endless OS.</p>
<h2 id="installing-flatpak">Installing Flatpak</h2>
<p>You will need Flatpak on your system to complete this walkthrough.
If you're using Endless OS, it is already included.
For other Linux distributions, check <a href="https://flatpak.org/getting.html">Flatpak's installation instructions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It's possible to complete the walkthrough and make an app without Flatpak, but you're on your own — packaging and installing an application using a different file format is outside the scope of this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="installing-the-endless-sdk">Installing the Endless SDK</h2>
<p>You'll need the Endless SDK, which is a Flatpak runtime.
Flatpak runtimes are split into the <strong>platform</strong>, which contains the minimum needed for <em>running</em> an app, and the <strong>SDK</strong>, which contains all the development tools needed for <em>creating</em> an app.
You will need both.
We'll use the latest stable version, which at the time of writing is 5.</p>
<p>If you're using Endless OS, you will already have the software source set up, and the platform runtime will already be installed.
You only need to install the SDK runtime:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">flatpak install eos-sdk com.endlessm.apps.Sdk//5
</code></pre>
<p>For other distributions, you will need to add the software source and install both runtimes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">flatpak remote-add --from eos-sdk http://endlessm.github.io/eos-knowledge-lib/eos-sdk.flatpakrepo
flatpak install eos-sdk com.endlessm.apps.Platform//5
flatpak install eos-sdk com.endlessm.apps.Sdk//5
</code></pre>
<p>See also <a href="http://endlessm.github.io/eos-knowledge-lib/contributing">the installation instructions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-nodejs">Installing NodeJS</h2>
<p>If you are following this tutorial on Endless OS, you will need to install NodeJS, since it's not included by default and there isn't a package for it.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">the NodeJS download page</a> and download the correct "Linux Binaries" package for your system.
Most likely, you will want the "64-bit" package.
Create a <code>.local</code> folder in your home directory and unzip the downloaded package there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir -p ~/.local
tar -C ~/.local -xJf node-v8.9.4-linux-x64.tar.xz --strip-components=1
</code></pre>
<p>Check if <code>~/.local/bin</code> is in your path (<code>echo $PATH</code>) and if not, add the following line to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file, then close and reopen the terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
</code></pre>
<h2 id="installing-hatch-previewer">Installing Hatch Previewer</h2>
<p>You'll also need a tool called Hatch Previewer.
It's available on Flathub, so if you're following this tutorial on Endless OS, you can install it from the App Center, or use the command line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">flatpak install flathub com.endlessm.HatchPreviewer
</code></pre>
<p>If you're on a different OS, you can follow <a href="https://flathub.org/">Flathub's instructions</a> to add it as a software source, or install Hatch Previewer via NPM.
If you choose the latter, the way to run it will be slightly different.</p>
<h2 id="installing-the-source-sans-pro-fonts">Installing the Source Sans Pro fonts</h2>
<p>We'll be using the Source Sans Pro font in our app.
You can find the latest release on its <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-sans-pro/releases/tag/variable-fonts">GitHub page</a>.
Download the <code>.otf</code> versions of the fonts.</p>
<p>We'll build these fonts into our apps, but in order for Hatch Previewer to find them during development, you should also copy them into your local fonts directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir -p ~/.fonts
cp ~/Downloads/SourceSans*.otf ~/.fonts
</code></pre>
